# Avail Work Order Manager

Avail’s P2P light client network provides efficient data availability and verification, making it easier to manage work order and government operations while keeping the public billing system decentralized and scalable. 

We are integrating Avail’s Light Client features with the zk Work Order wallet that seamlessly works across key Ethereum L2 Blockchains and leverages Zero Knowledge Proofs for Crypto-transactions and Identity proofs.

This network optimizes the performance of the platform, ensuring that data is easily retrievable and verifiable. We are also developing custom rollapps with Avail DA and tools to enable no code, low code analytics tooling using an open source analytics and visualization tool, namely Avail XLS, which enables tabulation, organization, collaboration, visualization, graphing and charting.
