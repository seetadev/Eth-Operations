# Nethermind : Starknet Implementation for Medical Incident Reporting

The Eth Operations DApp utilizes Nethermind (Starknet) for secure and scalable medical incident reporting. This integration leverages Starknet's zero-knowledge rollups to ensure efficient, privacy-preserving data handling, allowing for decentralized and tamper-proof reporting within the DApp.

Benefits:

Enable hyperlocal medical service and delivery information.

Enable QR code based blockchain payments at key sites with support for key Ethereum based blockchain platforms.

Enhance safety through smart incentivization of incident reporting by employees and logistics providers.

Additionally, the Eth Operations DApp uses verified medical incident data to mint NFTs on Voyager, which store an image and related insurance metadata. This process leverages Starknet and Argent Mobile to ensure secure and decentralized storage of medical records in the form of NFTs.

## Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (>= v18.17)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Scarb version

To ensure the proper functioning of scaffold-stark, your local `Scarb` version must be `2.5.4`. To accomplish this, first check your local Scarb version:

```sh
scarb --version
```

If your local Scarb version is not `2.5.4`, you need to install it.

<details>
<summary><b>Scarb Installation Process</b></summary>

To install Scarb, please refer to the [installation instructions](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/download).
We strongly recommend that you install
Scarb via [asdf](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/download.html#install-via-asdf), a CLI tool that can manage
multiple language runtime versions on a per-project basis.
This will ensure that the version of Scarb you use to work on a project always matches the one defined in the
project settings, avoiding problems related to version mismatches.

Please refer to the [asdf documentation](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html) to install all
prerequisites.

Once you have `asdf` installed locally, you can download Scarb plugin with the following command:

```bash
asdf plugin add scarb
```

This will allow you to download specific versions. You can choose the same version as the Dojo's Cairo version, for example, 2.5.4, with the following command:

```bash
asdf install scarb 2.5.4
```

and set a global version:

```bash
asdf global scarb 2.5.4
```

Otherwise, you can simply run the following command in your terminal, and follow the onscreen instructions. This
will install the version `2.5.4` of Scarb.

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/install.sh | sh -s -- -v 2.5.4
```

</details>

### Starknet Foundry version

To ensure the proper functioning of the tests on scaffold-stark, your Starknet Foundry version must be 0.25.0. To accomplish this, first check your Starknet Foundry version:

```sh
snforge --version
```

If your Starknet Foundry version is not `0.25.0`, you need to install it.

- [Starknet Foundry](https://foundry-rs.github.io/starknet-foundry/getting-started/installation.html)

## Compatible versions

- Scarb - v2.5.4
- Snforge - v0.23
- Cairo - v2.5.4
- Rpc - v0.5.1

## Quickstart

To get started with Scaffold-Stark 2, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repo and install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Quantum3-Labs/scaffold-stark-2 --recurse-submodules
cd scaffold-stark-2
yarn install
```

2. Prepare your environment variables.

By default Scaffold-Stark 2 takes the first prefunded account from `starknet-devnet` as a deployer address, thus **you can skip this step!**. But if you want use the .env file anyway, you can fill the envs related to devnet with any other predeployed contract address and private key from starknet-devnet.

**Note:** In case you want to deploy on Sepolia, you need to fill the envs related to sepolia testnet with your own contract address and private key.

```bash
cp packages/snfoundry/.env.example packages/snfoundry/.env
```

3. Run a local network in the first terminal.

**Note:** You can skip this step if you want to use Sepolia Testnet.

```bash
yarn chain
```

This command starts a local Starknet network using Devnet. The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development. You can customize the network configuration in `scaffold.config.ts` for your nextjs app.

**Note:** If you are on sepolia or mainnet, for a better user experience on your app, you can get a dedicated RPC from [Infura dashboard](https://www.infura.io/). A default is provided [here](https://github.com/Quantum3-Labs/scaffold-stark-2/tree/main/packages/nextjs/.env.example), in order to use this, you have to run `cp packages/nextjs/.env.example packages/nextjs/.env.local`


4. On a second terminal, deploy the sample contract:

```
yarn deploy --network {NETWORK_NAME} // when NETWORK_NAME is not specified, it defaults to "devnet"
```

**Note:** To use sepolia tesnet, you have to set {NETWORK_NAME} to `sepolia`.


This command deploys a sample smart contract to the local network. The contract is located in `packages/snfoundry/contracts/src` and can be modified to suit your needs. The `yarn deploy` command uses the deploy script located in `packages/snfoundry/scripts-ts/deploy.ts` to deploy the contract to the network. You can also customize the deploy script.

5. On a third terminal, start your NextJS app:

```
yarn start
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contract using the `Debug Contracts` page. You can tweak the app config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.

**What's next**:

- Edit your smart contract `YourContract.cairo` in `packages/snfoundry/contracts/src`
- Edit your frontend homepage at `packages/nextjs/app/page.tsx`. For guidance on [routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/defining-routes) and configuring [pages/layouts](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts) checkout the Next.js documentation.
- Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/snfoundry/script-ts/deploy.ts`
- Edit your smart contract tests in `packages/snfoundry/contracts/src/test`. To run tests use `yarn test`
