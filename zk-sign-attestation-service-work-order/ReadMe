The Sign Protocol is employed for work order verification and digital signing.

We have implemented a ZK Attestation Verifier with Schema Hooks using Sign Protocol's Schema Hooks and ZK Work Order Listing Verifier dapp, enabling builders to extend the core attestation protocol. This feature adds custom Work Order based Solidity logic, which is triggered each time an attestation is created or revoked for Contractor, Work Order and Contract Work schema. The Schema Hooks is utilized for whitelisting Work Order attesters, receiving Work Invoice and payments, and executing Work Order Listing Verifier application logic.

The ZK verification logic has been successfully implemented, ensuring secure and efficient attestations within the DApp. Implementation Flow: please visit demo at https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1IqKk0gP3Rh_tPAN0NfjnO3_Vba4VGRbK

Sign Protocol guarantees the authenticity of every document uploaded to the system. Users can create, sign, and verify work orders, contracts, agreements, or any important document directly on the blockchain.
